	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Writing efficient code is essential for building high-performance applications. By understanding and optimizing Time complexity, developers can ensure their solutions run faster and handle larger inputs smoothly.</p>
	<p>The algorithm uses additional memory proportional to the input size, resulting in a <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n).</p>
